  <!-- Mission Statement -->
  <div class="container">
    <h4>What is our goal?</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>Our goal for this website is to make the underlying structure of sentences more easily undertstood. When we read sentences we attach meaning to certain words based on arbitrary rules that we've been taught. What we'd like to do is make those rules seem more natural and not as concrete. Language is fluid and often adapting as times change. A great example of this is Olde English. What we see as an antiquated language was once much more commonplace. We'd like to pull the curtain back on the machinery behind English so come along.

        <p>Below you'll find several examples of complete sentence trees with their various parts of speech. Along with these trees will be explanations of what the tree means and what you should learn from them. Our hope is that not only will you learn how to break a sentence down, as shown, but also be able to identify the various components in sentences outside of this website.

        <h4>What is a Parse Tree?</h4>
        <p>A <em>parse tree</em> is an ordered, rooted tree representing the structure of a sentence, broken down to parts-of-speech.</p>

      <h4>How does this work?</h4>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
