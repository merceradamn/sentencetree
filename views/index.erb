  <!-- Mission Statement -->
  <div class="container">
    <h4>What is our goal?</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <p>Our goal for this website is to make the underlying structure of sentences more easily undertstood. When we read sentences we attach meaning to certain words based on arbitrary rules that we've been taught. What we'd like to do is make those rules seem more natural and not as concrete. Language is fluid and often adapting as times change. A great example of this is Olde English. What we see as an antiquated language was once much more commonplace. We'd like to pull the curtain back on the machinery behind English so come along.

        <p>Below you'll find several examples of complete sentence trees with their various parts of speech. Along with these trees will be explanations of what the tree means and what you should learn from them. Our hope is that not only will you learn how to break a sentence down, as shown, but also be able to identify the various components in sentences outside of this website.

        <h4>What is a Parse Tree?</h4>
        <p>A <em>parse tree</em> is an ordered, rooted tree representing the structure of a sentence, broken down to parts-of-speech. A tree shows the relationships between words within a sentence.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>Parts-of-Speech & Shorthand Used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>NP</b>, a noun phrase</li>
            <li><b>VP</b>, a verb phrase</li>
            <li><b>Det</b>, a determiner</li>
            <li><b>Nom</b>, a nominative</li>
            <li><b>Adv P</b>, an adverb phrase</li>
            <li><b>Adj P</b>, an adjective phrase</li>
            <li><b>N</b>, a noun</li>
            <li><b>V</b>, a verb</li>
            <li><b>Adj</b>, an adjective</li>

        <h4>How does this work?</h4>
        <p>As an example, look at the tree to the left. Starting at the bottom, from left to right, you see that “the” and “butterfly” connect to each other as a Noun Phrase (every node between the words and “NP” simply labels their parts of speech). These two words connect as one unit because they are a phrase and, therefore, can be replaced with a single word (the butterfly → it). </p>
        <p>Moving on to the next word, you have “grew” labeled as its own phrase. (You could potentially simplify grew to did and end up with “The butterfly did” or “It did.”) Ultimately these two phrases form a sentence with the NP being the subject and the VP being the predicate. All of these relationships are expressed through this tree.
